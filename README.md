# multithread-c-chat

A multithreaded chatroom written in C. Written for educational purposes to learn 
how socket programming works in C and how to do multithreading. 
Not very robust at the moment, still a webwork in progress. 

To get this working, compile server.c and client.c, run the executable for the server first, then launch the client executable.
